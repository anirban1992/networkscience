Ideas to look at

1) Correlation between coefficients
2) degree_pearson_correlation_coefficient and other similar ones provided by networkx
3) https://networkx.github.io/documentation/latest/examples/drawing/atlas.html - atlas like drawing (useful for analysis and meta level understanding)
4) Explore drawing - either matplotlib or pygraphviz
5) Explore facebook (as it seems to be the biggest collection)
